do not use anchor to link to webpage 
<a href="/users" > Users</a>
instead use Link in next js
<Link href="/users">Users </Link>

app director in  nextjs is server by default if you want to convert server page into client page add "use client"; in the top 
in server component we cannot use:
click event.
useHooks.

caching in next
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users", { next: { revalidate: 10 }}) -- in second argument refress after every ten second
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users", { cache:  "no-store" }) -- in second argument does not store in case we have new data every time.
